## Letter Frequency Analyzer

In this assignment, you will write a function that finds the frequency of each letter in a string.

### Description

Write a function that returns a 26-element list containing the frequency of each letter in a string.

The function's requirements are listed below

1. `letterFrequencyAnalyzer`
   - param {str}: `string` - the string to be analyzed
   - return {list}: a 26-element list of integers; the nth element of the list should contain the number of appearances of the nth letter of the alphabet in the given string
   - note: further requirements are as follows
     - ignore all punctuation and spaces
     - count both upper and lower case instances of a letter; for example the string "Aaron" would return a 2 in the first element of the list because there are two 'a's.

Include a main function that demonstrates your function analying at least two different strings. Ensure that you print the frequency lists to console.
